# Hello there üñê
This is our final project in **Data Science Programming**

---
Our team consists of:
- [Nguy·ªÖn Minh H∆∞ng](https://github.com/MinhHung7)
- [H√† ƒê·ª©c Huy](https://github.com/hahuy2004)
- [Tr·ªãnh Ho√†ng Khang](https://github.com/TrinhHoangKhang)

## üëâ Here are some information about this project
This project uses the knowledge acquired in the courses 
- **Data Science Introduction**
- **Data Science Programming**
- **Data Visuallization**

The dataset we use is [Anime Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset). You can click the link to navigate to dataset source.

In this project, we perform data preprocessing, data visuallization attributes relationships and then build systems using ML algorithms.
## üëâ Project Management
In this project, we use Notion for task and project management. We have also included additional information about the dataset here if you'd like to learn more

## üëâ Functions of files
- `PATHS.py`: This is where the paths to the dataset file are stored
- `anime_data_processing.ipynb`: preprocess the dataset. It includes cleaning, organizing, and preparing the data for analysis or modeling tasks, ensuring it is ready for further use in answering specific questions or building models.
- `anime_data_exploring.ipynb`: perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. This involves examining the data's structure, summary statistics, visualizations, and identifying patterns or anomalies to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and inform further analysis or modeling.
- `producer_studio_collaborations_analysis.ipynb`: analyze collaborations between producers and studios in the anime industry. This includes examining patterns, trends, and relationships in their partnerships, such as identifying frequently collaborating pairs, analyzing the impact of collaborations on anime production, and visualizing insights from the data
- `optimal_production_balance.ipynb`: analyze and determine the ideal balance in anime production factors. It includes evaluating metrics like episode count, and time per episode to achieve optimal production efficiency, quality, and audience satisfaction. The notebook uses data-driven methods to recommend strategies for improving production outcomes.
- `studio_genre_specialty.ipynb`: analyze the specialization of anime studios in different genres. This involves identifying which genres a studio excels in or frequently produces, exploring patterns in studio-genre associations, and providing insights into how genre specialization impacts the studio's reputation, audience reception, or success in the industry
- `anime_recommendation_using_cosine_similarity.ipynb`: is to build an anime recommendation system using cosine similarity. It likely compares users' preferences or anime features (e.g., genres, ratings, or tags) to calculate the similarity between items or users. Based on these similarities, the notebook generates personalized anime recommendations, helping users discover shows similar to their interests.
- `anime_rating_classification.ipynb` is to classify anime based on age ratings (such as "G," "PG," "PG-13," "R," etc.). This involves using features such as genre, content, and other metadata to predict the appropriate age rating for each anime. The notebook applies machine learning techniques to categorize the anime into different age groups based on the content, helping to identify which anime is suitable for specific age audiences.
## üëâ How to run
Since the dataset has been thoroughly cleaned by us in the Data Preprocessing folder, you can independently run the .ipynb files to see how we addressed the questions. In case you want to review how we processed the data, you can run the file `anime_data_processing.ipynb`.
## üëâ For contact and question
